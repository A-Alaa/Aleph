# Aleph &mdash; *A* *L*ibrary for *E*xploring *P*ersistent *H*omology

Aleph is a C++ library for exploring and extending usages of [persistent
homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_homology). Its main
goal is to provide users with a versatile, simple-to-use implementation
that quickly permits building prototype applications.

Aleph is inspired by [`DIPHA`](https://github.com/DIPHA/dipha) and
[`PHAT`](https://bitbucket.org/phat-code/phat). In particular, Aleph
borrowed the idea of keeping the *representation* of a boundary matrix
separate from the implementation.

For more information, please read the [original paper describing
`PHAT`](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mkerber/bkrw-pphat.pdf).
