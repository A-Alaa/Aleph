  @brief Distance measures based on point sets for persistence diagrams

  The purpose of this file is to collect some distance measures that
  treat a persistence diagram as a simple point set. Hence, parts of
  the topological structure will *not* be considered on purpose. The
  functions based in this file are mainly based on one publication:

  > Distance Measures for Point Sets and Their Computation
  > Thomas Eiter and Heikki Mannila
  > Acta Informatica, Volume 34, Issue 2, pp. 109â€“133
