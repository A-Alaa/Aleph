/*
  This is an example file shipped by 'Aleph - A Library for Exploring
  Persistent Homology'.

  This example demonstrates how to load a network---a graph---from
  a variety of input files.

  The graph will subsequently be expanded to a simplicial complex and
  the persistent homology of the graph will be calculated.

  Demonstrated classes:

    - aleph::PersistenceDiagram
    - aleph::geometry::RipsExpander
    - aleph::topology::io::EdgeListReader
    - aleph::topology::io::GMLReader
    - aleph::topology::io::PajekReader
    - aleph::topology::Simplex
    - aleph::topology::SimplicialComplex
    - aleph::topology::filtrations::Data

  Demonstrated functions:

    - aleph::calculatePersistenceDiagrams
    - aleph::utilities::extension
    - Betti numbers of persistence diagrams
    - Simplicial complex sorting (for filtrations)

  //   Afra Zomorodian
  //   Computers & Graphics, Volume 34, Issue 3, pp. 263-â€“271
  //
  // Formally speaking, the algorithm creates a k-simplex for subsets
  // of simplices in which k+1 simplices have pairwise intersections.
  //
  // Hence, if all three edges of a triangle are present, a 2-simplex
  // will be added to the simplicial complex.
