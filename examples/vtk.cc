/*
  This is an example file shipped by  'Aleph - A Library for Exporing
  Persistent Homology'.

  This example demonstrates how to load a VTK structured grid from
  a file, convert it into a simplicial complex, and calculate its
  persistent homology.

  Demonstrated classes:

    - aleph::PersistenceDiagram
    - aleph::topology::Simplex
    - aleph::topology::SimplicialComplex
    - aleph::topology::VTKStructuredGridReader

  Demonstrated functions:

    - aleph::calculatePersistenceDiagrams
    - Simplicial complex sorting (for filtrations)
